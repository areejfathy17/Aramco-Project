# 📊 Dynamic Evaluation & Performance Tracking System

## 📌 Project Overview

This project is a **Dynamic Performance Evaluation System** built for **Aramco**, designed to track, measure, and visualize departmental performance across multiple branches.
The system enables structured monitoring of requirements and frequency-based tasks (**Monthly, Weekly, Quarterly**), compares annual targets with actual performance, calculates completion rates automatically, and delivers a centralized interactive executive dashboard powered by a unified data model.

> ⚠️ Note: The dashboard screenshots included in this repository contain sample data for demonstration purposes only and do not represent actual company data.
